print ("Meghana Hanagodu")
print ("Place of stay: Hyderabad")
print ("Stream of study: Biotechnology")

# since def is a defined adress in python, we cant use it to define a variable. This is why the error was showing.

"""Answer 3 """
#if True:
#print "Answer"
#else:
#print "No Answer"
# the problem with this code is that there was no conditions given for the "if true" statements. We will have to give the conditions under which it will be true.

"""Answer 4"""
# there is no difference between single or double quotes because they both give the same output of printing the statements written inside them.
# triple quotes can be used to understand what the code is doing and write comments too.
